# How to apply conditional formatting to a range of cells (WPF Spreadsheet)


<p>This example illustrates how to get started with conditional formatting that can be applied to cells that match a certain condition specified by a conditional formatting rule.</p><p>In particular, this sample demonstrates how to use the SpreadsheetControl API to create the following types of conditional formatting rules:</p><p>- a rule that formats cells whose values are above or below the average;</p><p>- a rule that highlights cells whose values are between or not between two specified values;</p><p>- a rule that formats top or bottom ranked values;</p><p>- a rule that highlights cells containing the given text; </p><p>- a rule that formats unique or duplicate values, blank cells and formula errors;</p><p>- a rule that highlights cells containing dates in the specified time period;</p><p>- a rule that formats cells whose values meet the condition expressed by the relational operator;</p><p>- a rule that uses a formula to determine which cells to format; </p><p>- a two-color scale conditional formatting rule;</p><p>- a three-color scale conditional formatting rule;</p><p>- a data bar conditional formatting rule;</p><p>- an icon set conditional formatting rule. </p><br />
